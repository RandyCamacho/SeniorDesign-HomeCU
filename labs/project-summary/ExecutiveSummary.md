#### Executive Summary

Our team will build a proof of concept utility to show how modern technologies can replace problematic softare. Key points of user pain in the existing technologies have been identified and will be addressed in the proof of concept. The utility will include: a secure login, a list of credit unions, and addition actions to be taken on each credit union in the list. The main action that will be available is a Loan Application Editor which is a utility which provides users with a GUI to create and edit loan applications.
