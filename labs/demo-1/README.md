# Demo 1

You will present your project to the class. Due to teams using different technologies presentations will be team dependent. For example a team working on a Web based application can show off their website, a team working on a backend application can talk about the problems that they are solving. We want to allow all teams to present in 1 day, thus all presentations will be a **maximum** of 5 minutes. You will be cut off at the 5 minute mark so please practice your presentation before hand.

## Base requirements

  TODO: Tell me what you are doing :)

[Here](../../docs/demo-slide-deck.pptx) is an example presentation that you can build on.

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
