# Complete project

All your project source and test files should go here.

## Up and Running ##

### `.docker/.env` ###

Currently, there are no secrets to load into the `.docker/.env` file.  However,
the file still needs to exist.  Defaults or example values should go into the
`.docker/.env-example` file.

### Running Locally ###

After the `.docker/.env` file has been created , running the project should be
as simple as running `make dev-run`.
